**InnoJournal**



InnoJournal is my personal website where I share my projects, STEM journal entries, and a little bit about who I am. I created this site to keep all my work in one place and to document my learning journey in a simple, organized way.

About Me



🧰 Tech Stack

Right now, the website is built with:

\- HTML

\- CSS 

\- Maybe a little JavaScript later on  



I kept everything simple so it’s easy to update and maintain.



**✨ Purpose of the Project**

I built InnoJournal to:

\- Track my growth  

\- Keep all my work in one place  

\- Share my projects in a clean and simple way  

\- Build a portfolio I can use for programs, scholarships, and applications
